# Google Analytics Omeka Plugin

This Omeka plugin allows you to include the JavaScript for Google Analytics at
the bottom of any page.

To get set up for Google Analytics, visit [Google
Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/).  You may need to set up an
account and a profile for your Omeka site.

Once you've done that, install this plugin (see [Managing
Plugins](http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Plugins) for more information). On the
configuration screen, you will need to paste in the Google Analytics
JavaScript. You can do that by following these steps:

 1. Log onto [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)

 2. Click "Admin" in the bottom left

 3. Select the Account and Property you wish to add Google Analytics to

 4. Click "Tracking Info" then "Tracking Code"
 
 5. Copy the Tracking ID at the top of the page (starts with 'UA-')

 5. Paste it into the box on the plugin configuration page and save changes

That's it. You should start seeing results in Google Analytics in 24-48 hours.
